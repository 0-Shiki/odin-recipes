    <h1>Chicken Thighs in Pan Sauce</h1>
    <p>No image for this one, as it's my recipe and I've never taken pics of it :(</p>>
    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a fairly simple recipe of my own design. It's pretty easy to make and doesn't require many ingredients. Best done in a stainless steel pan.
        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>chicken thighs (preferably boneless but skin-on)</li>
                <li>neutral cooking oil</li>
                <li>mirin</li>
                <li>soy sauce</li>
                <li>half a shallot, diced</li>
                <li>rosemary</li>
                <li>a few tablespoons of butter</li>
                <li>salt</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If the chicken thighs are bone-in, remove the bone.</li>
                <li>Preheat the pan on medium to medium-high heat, then coat the bottom in your neutral cooking oil.</li>
                <li>Fry the chicken thighs until both sides are golden brown. As they fry, dice the shallot.</li>
                <li>Take the chicken thighs out and deglaze the pan with mirin, making sure to scrape up the fond. Add a splash of soy sauce and the diced 
                    shallot. Saute the shallot in the sauce until golden brown, then take off the heat.
                </li>
                <li>Once the sauce stops bubbling, add the butter and rosemary and incorporate until the sauce is creamy. Pour the sauce over the chicken and 
                    serve.
                </li>
            </ol>
